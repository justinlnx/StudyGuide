# number of ways to represent n cents
Given an infinite number of quarters (25 cents), dimes (10 cents), nickels (5 cents) and pennies (1 cent), write code to calculate the number of ways of representing n cents.

This is a recursive problem, so let's figure out how to do `makeChange(n)` using prior solutions (i.e., sub-problems). Let's say `n = 100`, so we want to compute the number of ways of making change of 100 cents. What's the relationship to its sub-problems?

We know that `makeChange(100)`:
= `makeChange(100 using 0 quarters)` + `makeChange(100 using 1 quarter)` + `makeChange(100 using 2 quarter)` + `makeChange(100 using 3 quarter)` + `makeChange(100 using 4 quarter)`

Can we reduce this further? Yes!

= `makeChange(100 using 0 quarters)` + `makeChange(75 using 0 quarter)` + `makeChange(50 using 0 quarters)` + `makeChange(25 using 0 quarters)` + 1

Now what? Weâ€™ve used up all our quarters, so now we can start applying our next biggest denomination: dimes.
This leads to a recursive algorithm that looks like this:
```java
public static int makeChange(int n, int denom) {
  int next_denom = 0;
  switch (denom) {
    case 25:
      next_denom = 10;
      break;
    case 10:
      next_denom = 5;
      break
    case 5:
      next_denom = 1;
      break;
    case 1:
      return 1;
  }
  int ways = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i * denom <= n; i++) {
    ways += makeChange(n - i * denom, next_denom);
  }
  return ways;
}
```

# Coin Change I, LC 322
You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

Example 1:

>Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11\
>Output: 3 \
>Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

Example 2:

>Input: coins = [2], amount = 3\
>Output: -1

## Solution:
```java
// DP
class Solution {
  public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
    int[] f = new int[amount + 1];
    f[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i ++) {
      f[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
      for (int j = 0; j < coins.length; j ++) {
        if (i - coins[j] >= 0 && f[i - coins[j]] != Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
          f[i] = Math.min(f[i], f[i - coins[j]] + 1);
        }
      }
    }
    
    return f[amount] == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : f[amount];
  }
}
```


# Coin Change II, LC 518
You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

Example 1:
>Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]\
>Output: 4\
>Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:\
>5=5\
>5=2+2+1\
>5=2+1+1+1\
>5=1+1+1+1+1

Example 2:
>Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]\
>Output: 0\
>Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.\

Example 3:
>Input: amount = 10, coins = [10]\
Output: 1

## Solution:
```java
// dp. calculation order is important
class Solution = {
  public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
    int [] comb = new int[amount + 1];
    comb[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < coins.length; i ++) {
      for (int j = 1; j <= amount; j ++) {
        if (j - coins[i] >= 0) {
          // counts every possible combinations with given coins
          // current combo + any prev value combo
          comb[j] = comb[j] + comb[j - coins[i]];
        }
      }
    }
    return comb[amount];
  }
}
```
