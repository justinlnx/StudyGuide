bq方面我就看了youtube上的一个小哥总结的，我感觉就够了。
[22 questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDKuX3BnBTk)
1. Tell me about a time you had to quickly adjust your work priorities to meet changing demands.
2. What did you do when you needed to motivate a group of individuals?
3. Give me an example of a time you faced a conflict while working on a team. How did you handle that?
4. The last time you had to apologize to someone
5. Describe a long-term project that you managed. How did you keep everything moving along in a timely manner?
6. Describe a situation when you negotiated with others in your organization to reach an agreement.
7. Tell me about a time when you received negative feedback from your manager. How did you respond?
8. Tell me about a time when you missed an obvious solution to a problem
9. A time when you faced a problem that had multiple possible solutions
10. Tell me about a time when you were 75% through a project, & you had to pivot strategy
11. Tell me about a time you had to deal with ambiguity
12. Tell me about the toughest decision you've had to make in the past six months
13. What’s the most innovative new idea that you have implemented?
14. Tell me about a time you stepped up into a leadership role
15. Describe a time when you sacrificed short term goals for long term success
16. Tell me about a time when you had to push back to HQ or challenged a decision
17. We all deal with difficult customers from time to time. Tell me about a challenging client-facing situation and how you handled it.
18. Tell me about a time when you were not able to meet a time commitment. What prevented you from meeting it? What was the outcome and what did you learn from it?
19. Tell me about a time you failed and what you learned from it
20. What's your strength / weakness
21. Tell me about yourself

还有要注意的就是如果讲failure就要用STARL，加一个learning，其实如果不主动讲learning，一般面试官也是问你的。自己准备了才知道如何回答。


最后 Ask interviewer：随便挑几个就行了

9. Why did you decide to join this company?
10. What are your favorite and least favorite things about working here?



我自己最后面试把所有的问题就分了几类，实际面试时那么多的bq也没跳出去这几类。就是要每类准备几个例子。
其实bq问题准备多了，实际操作意义不大，因为想不起。楼主听到bq，立马就分类了，也知道用什么LP，例子也想起来好几个，但是你需要根据具体的bq场景组织语言，思考个半分钟都会感觉时间长，因为面试官就等着敲键盘呢。所以复杂的bq操作没实际意义。
开始回答前最好把面试官的问题写下来，要不你讲一半，还要和面试官conversation几次，可能最初的问题就模糊了，因为你最后需要扣题，所以最好开始写下来。


楼主的bq回答过程是：
听到bq，并和面试官确认清楚，避免回答错了。（这段时间也能同时大脑里给问题归类）
用电脑记录下面试官的问题，简单的几个字就好。为了最后扣题用。
定位bq问题的分类，对应的PL，找其中一个例子回答。
用STAR( L)，ST的时候要点题，RL的时候要扣题。这样你的回答思路很清晰，面试官的答案结构明朗，最后简单的和你确认下故事就ok了。点题和扣题其实直接说PL的关键字也没问题。不需要太隐晦。

bq里面 failure问题很关键，需要多准备几个例子。楼主准备了5个。


如果没太多时间准备亚麻的bq，可以按照楼主最后总结的分类：

1. Failure：（Customer Obsession， Earn Trust ）五个例子
2. most challenging （Insist on the Highest Standards， Ownership ， Learn and Be Curious ）三个例子
3. miss deadline （Customer Obsession，Deliver Results ，Ownership，Dive Deep）两个例子
4. conflict （Customer Obsession， Earn Trust ）两个例子
5. took a risk, or do not have much time to make a decision （Bias for Action， Ownership ）三个例子
6. challenges from customers. （Customer Obsession， Earn Trust ）一个例子
7. negative feedback （Earn Trust ）一个例子
8. sacrifice short for long goal （Think Big）一个例子
9. tough decision  （Bias for Action ）一个例子


General bq
Why amazon
Introduce yourself
Weakness and strength


整个bq准备其实没什么需要死记硬背的，效果也不好。
故事自己写的，不需要背。大声的给自己讲一遍就好。有些细节忘记没关系。面试官不清楚的会followup的
问题分类和对应的LP也是很好理解的。比如Failure，肯定对应Customer Obsession，还有就是earn trust.  比如negative feedback, 肯定是需要改进，重新获得信任啊 对应earn trust。

还有就是例子，哪来的这么多例子呢？
例子肯定是准备的越多越好，不重复
一个例子可以套进几个分类中，但是从不同的角度回答。（最开始把题目写下来的重要性，同一个例子，不同角度的点题和扣题）
