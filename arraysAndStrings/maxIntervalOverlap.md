# Find the point where maximum intervals overlap
Consider a big party where a log register for guestâ€™s entry and exit times is maintained. Find the time at which there are maximum guests in the party. Note that entries in register are not in any order.
Example : 

>Input: arrl[] = {1, 2, 9, 5, 5}\
>       exit[] = {4, 5, 12, 9, 12}\
>First guest in array arrives at 1 and leaves at 4, second guest arrives at 2 and leaves at 5, and so on.\
>\
>Output: 5\
>There are maximum 3 guests at time 5.  

```java
class Solution {
  public int maxOverlap(int[] start, int[] end, int n) {
    Arrays.sort(start);
    Arrays.sort(end);

    int guestsIn = 1, maxGuests = 1, time = start[0];
    int i = 1, j = 0;

    while (i < n && j < n) {
      if (start[i] <= exit[j]) {
        guestsIn ++;

        if (guestsIn > maxGuests) {
          maxGuests = guestsIn;
          time = start[i];
        }
        i++;
      } else {
        guestsIn --;
        j ++;
      }
    }

    return i;
  }
}
